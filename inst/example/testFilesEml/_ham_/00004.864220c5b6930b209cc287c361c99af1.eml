There is a quote: "One should eat to live, not live to eat". So, it means that we do not have to pay so much attention to the food anyway. And even more, there are a lot of people who eat junk food, drink alcohol, smoke and are full of health and strength. And there are people, who take care of themselves, lead a healthy life, get regular check-ups and die early. No one can become immune to death regardless of how much he or she tries. But if you have time to watch what you are eating, it is better to use this opportunity and not to push the luck blaming the restaurants for tempting you with yummy snacks.
