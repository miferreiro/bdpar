For some people, food is just a necessity to satisfy basic needs; for the others, food is more than just a basic necessity, but a pleasure that plays a significant role in their understanding of happiness. There are so many different cuisines and food preferences built by cultural and ethnical backgrounds, geographical locations and social classes. Food and popular meals can tell us a lot about the history and traditions of various nations and regions. Meat eating habits, herbs, and crops everything makes its contribution to the traditional cuisine and culture. India is a land of spices, Africa is a continent of sauces, Europe discloses esthetical beauty of food and opens up new opportunities and inventions for those who value and enjoy eating.

Eating habits change over time and follow climate, cultural and other transformations that determined the evolution of the communities. Changes in the way people serve the table, evolution of European and Asian business etiquette, food preferences according to the surveys in different countries and other elements that allow measuring and analyzing the evolution of food help us understand the history.
