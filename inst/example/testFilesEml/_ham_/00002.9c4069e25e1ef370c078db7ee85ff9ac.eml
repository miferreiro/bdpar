High fructose corn syrup,(HFCS) is a sweetener that is derived from corn that has pushed all sugar aside.It undergoes lab processing in order to turn its glucose into fructose to create a paste that is similar to sugar. HFCS is much cheaper to make than sugar; so,  food manufacturers prefer to use high fructose corn syrup products instead of sugar. Most soft drink manufacturers replaced their sugar to corn sweeteners; likewise, so have snack productions because it saves the company thousands of dollars opposed to using sugar. "By far the best strategy for keeping zea mays (the botanical name for both sweet and feed corn) business has been the development of high fructose corn syrup."(Pollan 7). He states here how desperately we as well as other food producers depend so heavily on corn crops in order to make profits. What ingredients contain corn you may ask? Corn is behind most popular ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, Monosodium glutamate (processed "flavor enhancer), citrate, Dextrose (glucose) etc. In addition, to common sweeteners, there are also preservatives, color additives, flavor enhancers, and nutrients.
